# Redis 简介

<pre>

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker. 
It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs 
and geospatial indexes with radius queries. 
Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, 
and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
